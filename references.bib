	shorttitle = {Effective Characteristics of Formal Mentoring Relationships},
	abstract = {Context: Mentoring is a beneficial mechanism to support junior faculty members as they navigate job expectations, institutional nuances, and the professional landscape during the first few years as a faculty member. Whereas effective characteristics of informal mentoring relationships are generally understood, less is known about factors that contribute to formal mentoring relationships. Objective: Gain mentor and mentee perceptions of effective mentoring in a formal setting. Design: Qualitative phenomenology. Setting: Higher education institutions. Patients or Other Participants: Six mentees (4 women and 2 men with 3 ± 4 years in their current faculty position) and 4 mentors (2 women and 2 men with an average of 10 ± 3 years in their current faculty position) participating in the 2015 National Athletic Trainers' Association Foundation mentor-program cohort. Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed one telephone interview before starting the mentor program and one interview upon program completion 11 months later. Participants also completed 3 structured online journals at 3-month increments throughout their participation in the program. Two researchers independently analyzed the interview and journal data using a phenomenological approach. To improve trustworthiness, we used peer review and pilot testing of the interview guides, member-checks, and multiple-analyst triangulation. Results: Participants described effective mentoring relationships as those that facilitated collaboration and demonstrated humanistic qualities. Participants who collaborated on scholarly activities during their mentoring experience perceived this to be a highly valuable aspect of the experience that increased the potential for a long-lasting relationship. Whereas the mentoring focused on professional development, humanistic attributes such as approachability and personal connections further enriched participants' mentoring experiences. Conclusions: Participants in formal mentoring experiences describe effective mentoring characteristics similarly to those who have participated in informal mentoring and should be encouraged to exhibit them. Additionally, coordinators of formal mentoring programs should provide participants with resources and guidance to facilitate their experiences. {ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}},

	abstract = {Purpose
This paper aims to present a literature review of studies of mentorship programs in the manufacturing industry so as to lay a theoretical basis for learning at work.
A literature review with focus on mentorship programs in the manufacturing industry was used. A search for relevant peer-reviewed articles, in four databases, rendered 315 hits, but only one article dealt with mentorship programs in an industry similar to the manufacturing industry. Thus, it is concluded that there is a lack of research on this area. The selection criteria were broadened so as to include 16 articles on mentorship programs for learning at work.
Three dominant areas emerged from this review: definitions of mentorship, characteristics of a good mentor and mentorship program structures. The establishment of a mentorship program requires a clear purpose; contextual knowledge; and adaption to the profession, the organization and to individual needs. In addition to their findings, the authors discuss relationships in mentoring programs, what can be understood by “reading between the lines” and the ongoing digitalization of mentorship programs.
Mentorship has proven itself to be a superior way to learn on the job. This paper provides practical information about establishing mentorship programs in the manufacturing industry, with a particular focus on the moulding industry.},

	abstract = {This article deals with the demands that plagiarism places on academic communities, and with the resources staff possess in dealing with these demands. It is suggested that plagiarism ought to be placed in the context of network of intertwining communities (scholarly, pedagogical and administrative), to which participants are engaged to a different extent. The relationship to the ethical issue of plagiarism is related to the subject’s engagement in these communities. The article examines the way teachers deal with plagiarism from the point of view of work engagement and work-related wellbeing. In particular, we analyse job demands created by episodes of dealing with plagiarism as well as job resources teachers possess that aid them in coping with these demands. We used thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews of teachers in two universities. Our results show that the demands fall on five thematic categories: 1. rupture in the personal pedagogical relationship, 2. challenge on the supervisory “gatekeeping” responsibility; 3. a breach of the “everyday normality”; 4. ambivalence in explaining plagiarism and 5. the strain of performing the act of accusation. A key job demand in dealing with plagiarism is that teachers must balance both rule-ethical and care-ethical orientations in their reactions and actions. The resources teachers draw upon when dealing with these demands are: 1) dialogue and reflection in collegial dialogue 2) support from superiors and administration 3) shared protocols, procedures and plagiarism detection software. Our analysis shows that there are various demands that make dealing with plagiarism a strenuous task, but university environments also provide teachers with resources to cope with them.},

To structure the presentation of the research contributions, we propose novel technically oriented typologies for plagiarism prevention and detection efforts, the forms of academic plagiarism, and computational plagiarism detection methods. We show that academic plagiarism detection is a highly active research field. Over the period we review, the field has seen major advances regarding the automated detection of strongly obfuscated and thus hard-to-identify forms of academic plagiarism. These improvements mainly originate from better semantic text analysismethods, the investigation of non-textual content features, and the application of machine learning. We identify a research gap in the lack of methodologically thorough performance evaluations of plagiarism detection systems. Concluding from our analysis, we see the integration of heterogeneous analysis methods for textual and non-textual content features using machine learning as the most promising area for future research contributions to improve the detection of academic plagiarism further.},

	abstract = {Peer mentoring programs frequently are implemented on college campuses to enhance first-year college student retention; however, few studies have examined characteristics of peer mentors that are associated with more supportive mentor–mentee relationships, leaving college personnel with a limited understanding of how to improve these vital programs. Accordingly, in this prospective study, we examined whether mentors’ attachment style and self-efficacy to mentor predicted peer mentors’ (n = 76) or mentees’ (n = 999) ratings of mentor-provided support. Results showed that mentor self-efficacy mediated the relation between an avoidant attachment style and mentor-reported support; that is, peer mentors with a more avoidant attachment style reported lower self-efficacy to mentor and, in turn, endorsed providing lower levels of support for mentees. Mentor–mentee contact, however, was the only predictor of mentees’ ratings of mentor support. Future research should aim to extend these preliminary findings so as to inform the selection, training, and supervision of peer mentors in college settings, with the ultimate goal of enhancing first-year student retention.},

December 10)This paper argues the importance to the creative practitioner in finding the right mentor as an axis for growth. The discussion interchanges the terms ‘artist’ and ‘practitioner’, not to denote broad scopes of diverse disciplines but to mean the creative writer in a research setting. It applies the term ‘creative practice’ to mean the duality of artist and scholar in action research. The personal communication from the Australasian {PhD} student is witness to the solitary milieu in which artists in doctoral settings find themselves. The right mentor can trigger or catalyse insight to the solitary artist to whom isolation is not an optimal setting; collaboration and participation are vital elements providing important tensions that add value to a work. Wings from the artist’s isolation, runways to the ‘leap’, may emerge in the form of another author, a supervisor, a peer reviewer, an editor—all seemingly non-collaborative participants—whose association is crucial to locating and asserting the best form of the artist’s work.},

The focal reasons behind this increasing dilemma are the researchers’ attitudes and their different cultural perspectives. The spread of Information and Communication Technology provides avenues for academic dishonesty since detecting software products do not offer a real solution. As such, the incentive of this study is to scrutinize how Information and Communication Technology can help in attaining academic integrity. It also intends to see what is behind the backdrop of the academic misconduct, i.e., the motives that lead researchers to switch to e-dishonesty. The present survey seeks to bring the issue of Information and Communication Technology and academic integrity into the light to ensure honesty among the Algerian researchers. The researcher collected data through a questionnaire addressed to four Masterclasses in English studies at Mascara and Saida Universities supported by an interview with teachers. The findings revealed that most students used technology in cheating and plagiarism. The findings also revealed that universities and institutions can achieve integrity if the learners are aware of the positive side of Information and Communication Technology in academic research.},

The article questions the conceptualisation of change agents of gender equality as either tempered radicals, for micro change agents, or heroic leaders, for macro change agents, and argues instead that to be macro change agents for gender equality, {CEOs} need to display post-heroic leadership and tempered radicalism to foster change in regard to gender relations.},

To support the change, employees were appointed change agents and trained in running seminars to facilitate the change. Using Person-Job fit as our theoretical framework, we proposed that change agents who perceived they possess the necessary competencies to deal with the change agent role (Person-Role fit) would feel more efficacious in this role and be more satisfied with their jobs post-change. We suggested that role-specific self-efficacy mediated the relationship between person-role fit and job satisfaction and that the most dissatisfied pre-change would perceive the greatest improvements in job satisfaction. Using a paired t-test, repeated measures analyses and mixed methods mediation testing, we found that change agents (N = 110) reported increased job satisfaction post-change. Change agents who were dissatisfied with their jobs pre-change, but perceived a good fit to the change agent role, reported the greatest improvements in job satisfaction. No significant results were found for self-efficacy.},

Leaders' connections to different fisheries are evaluated, and these actors are found to be significantly more diversified than other fishers in the area. Drawing on theory related to institutional entrepreneurship and a series of in-depth interviews with these actors, this paper puts forward several hypotheses to explain how diverse social-ecological connections facilitate leadership. Three mechanisms are identified. Being diversified facilitates: (1) production of alternative visions; (2) framing of tractable strategies to sustain local marine resource; and (3) participation in the management process. While more research is needed to understand the relationship between diversification and leadership, these exploratory results suggest that leadership is, in part, a manifestation of ecological circumstance, supporting recent assertions that scholarship on leadership in natural resource management settings could benefit from being more attentive to the processes that shape leadership rather than fixating on individuals and their personal attributes. Given that fisheries policies increasingly constrain diversification, policymakers and managers should consider how specialization of fishers might change the form and function of leaders in the future.},

	abstract = {An extensive literature has focused on the impact of new public management ({NPM}) oriented structural changes on academics’ practice and identity. These critical studies have been resolute in concluding that {NPM} inevitably leads to a degeneration of academics’ ethos and values. Drawing from the moral philosophy of Alasdair {MacIntyre}, we argue that these previous analyses have overlooked the moral agency of the academics and their role in ‘moralizing’ and consequently shaping the ethical nature of their practices. The paper provides a new theoretical understanding of {NPM}-oriented reforms in light of the virtue ethics approach, thereby directing the attention to the moral character and moral agency of academics. Our analysis of interviews collected in the business department of a Danish university provides an example of how individuals have divergent ethical understandings of these structural changes and enact/resist pre-defined social roles in different ways. While in some cases the {NPM} agenda of the institutions has triggered internal moral conflict and a crisis of moral character, in other cases the new logic resonates with academics’ values and evaluative standards. Partially departing from the theoretical ground of {MacIntyre} (1981), we conclude that academics can play a crucial role in shaping the morality of {NPM}-oriented institutions and in transforming these settings into suitable contexts for the cultivation of virtues.},

	abstract = {Ethical leadership is the best response in the crisis state of postmodern man. Ethical leadership is a construct that leads to personal transfiguration, organizational effectiveness, improved interpersonal communication, and the achievement of a joint platform for professional action. Its development has also a beneficial effect as it brings ethics back to the core of public action, to the front line of organizational life and personal development. Whether it follows a religious model or a model resulting from laicized religious values, leadership construing is based on a personal development process that follows an initiating structure in the world of values and their practice in personal ethical action. This is doubled by an ethics institutionalization process in which the organization itself becomes a structure of ethical and effective communication both inside and outside. An authentic leadership supposes positing the leader in the center of an ethical edifice in which achieving public good is done through instruments of personal development, ethics management and managerial ethics, ethical responsibility and sustainability, human condition improvement, spiritual transfiguration and authenticity. Added to this is the leader's personal effort of involvement in the organization. Ethical leadership relies on a person's vocation of developing an ethical culture in professional situations and in all life experiences.},

	abstract = {This article refers to selected issues elaborated from my interdisciplinary doctoral thesis accomplished at the University of South Africa in 2019. I investigated the ethical-theoretical frameworks as well as practices of Christian humanitarian non-governmental organisations ({NGOs}) in Germany by combining a theoretical part (including philosophy, theology, business studies and development studies) and an empirical part. The empirical part was accomplished by interviewing 11 {NGOs} from the humanitarian field (development and/or relief agencies in an international context). The findings of theory and practice showed that many Christian {NGOs} typically conform to the secular mindset and regulations in order to be able to function as organisations. The results also revealed that Christian {NGOs} have difficulties in defining their identity in order to be attractive and convincing to their current and prospective employees and donors. In addition, organisational and hierarchical structures are mostly taken from business companies but do not necessarily always fit to the individual organisations. The research is significant because it shows to what extent these {NGOs} experience tensions and insecurities having to work in a secular environment, and it helps to identify some typical challenges that Christian organisations face in Western countries. The purpose of the thesis was to impact on the reflection and practice of leaders of {NGOs} in their quest to understand developments and paradigm shifts, and ensure that they will act in a recognisably Christian way.Contribution: This article has been held as a presentation at the Leadership Conference in Pretoria, South Africa, in 2019. It contributes to the research of specific Christian leadership, and particularly of leadership in Christian non-governmental organisations. This article aims to describe the challenges these organisations face, having to work in the midst of a secular environment.},

	abstract = {In considering what it means to lead organizations effectively and ethically, the literature comprising spirituality at work ({SAW}) and spiritual leadership theory ({SLT}) has become highly influential, especially in the {USA}. It has also attracted significant criticism. While in this paper, we endorse this critique, we argue that the strand of literature which purportedly takes a Christian standpoint within the wider {SAW} school of thought, largely misconstrues and misapplies the teaching of its founder, Jesus. As a result, in dismissing the claims and application of {SAW} and {SLT}, there is a real risk that we lose the vital contribution of Christian thought, not least some of the timeless counter-cultural wisdom of Jesus which, we contend, offers a vital foundation to the practice of ethical leadership and business ethics in organizations. In proposing a way forward, two thorny issues which face all leaders are addressed: dealing with ego and closing the gap between what we say and what we do. The more we understand about the dynamics of human nature, the more we learn about the profundity of Jesus’ teachings. We then propose a number of ways in which Jesus-centred ethical leadership can be practised. Each is radical and each implies risk: both the personal risk of inner renewal arising from repentance as a doorway to personal integrity, as well as the risk of opposing unethical practices and promoting the excellence of core practices in the workplace.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the level at which the charismatic leadership style of school principals perceived by teachers predicts the school culture. Research Method: The correlational model, a quantitative research model, was conducted. In this study, 490 teachers participated in Uskudar, Istanbul. The School Culture Scale (Terzi, 2005) and the Charismatic Leadership Scale (Conger \& Kanungo, 1994) were used to measure the teacher's perception of the charismatic leadership and school culture. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the relationship between the charismatic leadership style and the school culture perceived by the teachers. Regression analysis was performed to determine whether the charismatic leadership style was a predictor of school culture. Findings: The findings obtained after the analyses showed that there was a significant positive relationship between the charismatic leadership and the success culture, support culture, mission culture, and bureaucratic culture and that the charismatic leadership style was a predictor of, respectively, the success culture, support culture, mission culture, and bureaucratic culture. The charismatic leadership explains 29\% of the total variance in mission culture, 35\% of the total variance in support culture, 36\% of the total variance in success culture and 5\% of the total variance in bureaucratic culture. Implications for Research and Practice: The charismatic leadership role of school principals in shaping the school culture should be emphasized. It may be suggested that charismatic leaders who manage the school culture effectively can be successful. (English)},

They also comment on the Ohio State studies on leadership, and then discuss the ways in which these many styles overlap with transformational leadership and each other, and issue a call to leadership researchers to collectively develop a new 'full-range' model of leadership that encompasses and distills what is unique about these various styles.

Drawing on the attraction–selection–attrition model of organizational behavior, we propose a selective attrition effect whereby unethical leader behavior results in the retention of group members who are more comfortable with dishonesty and, consequently, more likely to engage in unethical behavior toward their group. In two experiments, exposure to unethical leader behavior (vs. ethical leader behavior) increased group members’ likelihood of choosing to leave the group. Members who chose to remain in a group with an unethical leader were more likely than those who chose to leave to cheat their group in a subsequent task. A two time-period survey replicated these findings and identified psychological distress as the mechanism driving group members’ turnover intentions. This research extends our understanding of the complex relationships between unethical leadership and follower turnover intentions, psychological distress, and malfeasance. We contribute to the behavioral ethics literature by identifying a previously underappreciated form of selective attrition that produces internal costs to groups and organizations, independent of reputational consequences and whether the unethicality is publicized.},

A total of 97 employees from a non-profit organization completed measures of their abusive supervision and corporate psychopathy traits as well as self-report measures of job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Corporate psychopathy was positively and significantly correlated with abusive supervision and turnover intentions and negatively correlated with employees' job satisfaction. {SEM} results indicate that, although the B-Scan 360 has a direct influence on turnover intentions, it influences job satisfaction through abusive supervision behavior.

	abstract = {The dark triad, composed of Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism, refers to negative personality traits, which may influence business processes. While negative traits could be an important factor explaining the relationship between a {CEO}’s immoral and unethical behavior and corporate social responsibility ({CSR}), there has been minimal research focusing on this relationship. This paper thus attempts to investigate how a {CEO} exhibiting these negative traits affects {CSR}, and if an employee’s perception of ethics and social responsibility would mediate the relationship. In addition, this paper considers the moderating effects of an individual performance-based compensation system ({IPBCS}) between employee’s {CSR} perception and {CSR} activities. The data are collected through a survey conducted on 165 employees (companies) in twelve industries. The regression result indicates an inverse relationship between the negative traits of a {CEO} and an employee’s perception of ethics and social responsibility and {CSR} activities, and the mediating effect of the perception in the relationship between the negative traits and {CSR} activities. It also indicates that an {IPBCS} moderates the relationship between {CSR} perception and activities. Implications for the study, future research directions, and management approach are discussed.},

To understand what ultimately are considered leadership traits that are contrary to good order, discipline and productivity, the author conducted a review of the literature to obtain a current typology (the grouping of items by their similarities) of selected harmful leadership styles--specific styles that are counter to enabling others to succeed, overcome challenges, achieve desired results, and create a positive environment in which to work. The paper focused on three distinctly harmful leadership styles (abusive, bullying, and toxic), and set these in context with each other and within the domain of destructive leadership in general. Commonalities, measurements, negative impacts, and ways to improve these harmful leadership styles were identified from the literature and detailed.

Two leadership styles (task oriented and authoritarian styles) were identified as possible mediators.

Sinha's leadership scale (Sinha, 2008) was used to measure task-oriented and authoritarian leadership styles. 273 senior-level managers of a big public sector Indian organization participated in the study. {SPSS} 22 and {SmartPLS} 2.0 were used to analyze the data. Findings Correlation result shows that narcissism personality trait was positively related to authoritarian leadership style and negatively to task-oriented leadership style, task performance and teamwork dimensions of performance. Task-oriented leadership style mediated the relationship between narcissism and task performance and teamwork more than the authoritarian leadership style. Originality/value The study attempts to empirically test the behavioral manifestation of narcissism personality trait as positive or negative and has considered the whole measure of performance which has not been previously explored.

This study extends research on multiplicative effects of normative leader characteristics to consider how narcissism becomes particularly disruptive when combined with other extreme interpersonal tendencies. Moderated multiple regression results show interactions involving selected trait pairs varied across samples. Pooled analyses showed (a) differential generalizability across trait pairings and (b) that lower tiered managerial roles and weaker industrial contexts may release such effects. Inconsistencies suggest the need to consider sample-specific trait demands in future trait interaction research, normal, or maladaptive. All told, findings suggest that subclinical personality interactions might accelerate leader derailment, offer unique insights into leader competence, and extend trait interaction research to aberrant tendencies.},

Drawing from Ashforth’s (2001) model of role transitions we propose and test a model wherein mentoring experiences of early career professionals relate to short- and long-term career goals through professional identification. Using survey data collected at three points in time from 312 early career professionals, we find that psychosocial mentoring, but not career mentoring, positively relates to professional identification. For short-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic goals, intrinsic goals, and goals that are high quality (i.e., specific, difficult, to which one is committed). For long-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic and intrinsic goals, but not to goal quality. Instead, in the long-term goal model, psychosocial mentoring is directly related to goal quality. The theoretical and practical implications of this study for professional identification, career goals, and how mentors can facilitate career goals are discussed.

These are issues like humility, love, self-issues, confidence, as well as issues of ontology and how to teach servant leadership. In this study, Scripture has nuanced, expanded, and even critiqued the contemporary model of servant leadership. It is here that the virtue model of servant leadership is expanded based upon the biblical perspective that has the wisdom of antiquity as well as divine insights. This model has three stages of preparation for leadership that is personal and ontological; it brings real change to the person. The first stage is foundational with several ingredients for development and even keys for the process itself. The second stage is the process of leadership, and it includes virtues like the contemporary theory of servant leadership. However, it adds other attributes of leadership related to authority, guidance, and gifting. Then there is a final stage or third stage at the end of the leadership term, but it impacts how one leads in the second stage. Together this forms a robust though complicated model for biblical servant leadership.},

Specifically, the study intends to develop a model of efficacy beliefs that mediates the relationships between servant leadership, employee creativity, and team creativity at different levels. The study also aims to investigate the moderating effects of team power distance on the relationships between servant leadership, creative self-efficacy, and team efficacy at both individual and team levels. Design/methodology/approach Servant leadership, employee creativity, creative self-efficacy, team creativity, team efficacy, and team power distance were assessed in an empirical study based on a sample of 466 employees and 83 team leaders from 11 banks in China. Findings From efficacy theory perspective, this paper finds that servant leadership promotes employee creative self-efficacy and team efficacy, which enables the simultaneous promotion of employee creativity and team creativity. Team power distance also moderates the relationship between servant leadership and team efficacy. Practical implications The results suggest that it is important to encourage managers to engage in servant leader behaviors, which is conductive to enhancing employees’ self-efficacy beliefs and thereby improving creative outcomes of employees. The results are also helpful for managers to enhance their understanding of the differences in cultural values in management behavior and the effects of behavior on team efficacy. Originality/value The research findings provide a significant contribution to the literature in that it shows self-efficacy as a crucial mediating mechanism through which servant leadership influences creativity at individual and team levels. Moreover, the findings support the view that power distance is an important contextual factor that affects the influencing mechanism of servant leadership on team creativity.

Building on social information-processing theory, we examine whether and how a servant leadership style influences employees’ emotional labor. Using a sample of 305 employees in 81 work units of 25 subcorporations at a food company in China, we find that servant leadership relates negatively to surface acting (i.e., regulating facial expressions) but relates positively to deep acting (i.e., regulating inner feelings) at work. We also find that the indirect effect of servant leadership on surface/deep acting via affective trust is stronger than the indirect effect via cognitive trust. Our research reveals that servant leadership influences employees’ emotional labor more through affective trust than cognitive trust. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the influencing mechanism of servant leadership on employee and team creativity based on efficacy theory. Specifically, the study intends to develop a model of efficacy beliefs that mediates the relationships between servant leadership, employee creativity, and team creativity at different levels. The study also aims to investigate the moderating effects of team power distance on the relationships between servant leadership, creative self-efficacy, and team efficacy at both individual and team levels. Design/methodology/approach Servant leadership, employee creativity, creative self-efficacy, team creativity, team efficacy, and team power distance were assessed in an empirical study based on a sample of 466 employees and 83 team leaders from 11 banks in China. Findings From efficacy theory perspective, this paper finds that servant leadership promotes employee creative self-efficacy and team efficacy, which enables the simultaneous promotion of employee creativity and team creativity. Team power distance also moderates the relationship between servant leadership and team efficacy. Practical implications The results suggest that it is important to encourage managers to engage in servant leader behaviors, which is conductive to enhancing employees’ self-efficacy beliefs and thereby improving creative outcomes of employees. The results are also helpful for managers to enhance their understanding of the differences in cultural values in management behavior and the effects of behavior on team efficacy. Originality/value The research findings provide a significant contribution to the literature in that it shows self-efficacy as a crucial mediating mechanism through which servant leadership influences creativity at individual and team levels. Moreover, the findings support the view that power distance is an important contextual factor that affects the influencing mechanism of servant leadership on team creativity. Furthermore, this paper is one of the few studies answering the call to examine the effect of leadership at multiple levels.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine how servant leadership and political skill combine to impact workplace spirituality and employee creativity.
Design/methodology/approach
Participants were working adults recruited by graduate and undergraduate students from a {US} public regional comprehensive university. Data were collected across three time periods, with a final sample size of 280 participants.
Findings
The authors' findings suggest that servant leaders impact employee creativity by fostering an environment that promotes workplace spirituality. Furthermore, this relationship is strengthened to the extent that the servant leader possesses high levels of political skill.
Research limitations/implications
This study provides a foundation for the interplay between servant leadership and political skill. Therefore, the data collection procedures undertaken in this study (i.e. from sources in multiple organizations) are beneficial. A limitation to this study is the use of a single informant to measure all of the constructs, which may cause a bias in the results.
Practical implications
This study provides a foundation for the interplay between servant leadership and political skill. Therefore, the data collection procedures undertaken in this study (i.e. from sources in multiple organizations) are beneficial.
Originality/value
Although servant leadership research continues to receive increased attention in the extant literature, researchers have tended to focus on the relational aspects of servant leadership. Curiously, the "leader" side of servant leadership has been largely neglected. As a result, some have questioned the construct as a viable leadership model. Greenleaf (1977), however, noted that servant leaders also possess conceptual skills; yet, these skills are rarely included in servant leadership measurements or empirical studies. The authors argue that political skill captures the essence of these abilities, and that including it strengthens the servant leader's impact on workplace spirituality, ultimately influencing employee creativity.},

	abstract = {Top management teams ({TMTs}) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the {TMT} and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the {TMT} and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that {TMTs} and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 × 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper makes the case that a balanced view of strategic leadership can be developed by synthesizing strategic leadership theory ({SLT}) and the balanced scorecard theory ({BSCT}). According to this view, 1) {BSC} is reconceived as a set of choices made by strategic leaders. 2) Such choices are purposely planned and directed in four domains set by {BSCT} in a balanced fashion to give them more purpose and strategic momentum. 3) Strategies of the firm can be mapped from a behavioural view of {BSC}. We believe, not only this view helps advance strategic leadership theory in a more systematic way but it also offers new avenues to make use of balanced scorecard theory. This marriage also offers new insights into the behavioural side of strategy mapping and performance measurement previously done mechanistically by {BSCT} without considering the behavioural components of strategy as stressed in {SLT}.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to determine whether teacher collaboration is a mediator of the strategic leadership and teaching quality in schools. This study involved 300 teachers in the high prestige secondary schools in Kelantan, Malaysia, whereby a cross-sectional survey approach using a standard questionnaire was used. The strategic leadership instrument used has been adapted from Hairuddin Ali (2012), while the collaborative instrument has been adapted from Barkema and Moran (2013). In addition, to measure the teaching quality among teachers, the researcher adapted the questionnaire that has been developed by Shahril Marzuki (2005). The findings from multiple regression analysis show that teacher collaboration is a mediator of strategic leadership and teaching quality (B=0.14, p{\textless}0.05). It was recommended among others that the school leaders should continue to strengthen collaborative practices among teachers as an effort to improve teaching quality in their respective schools which in turn will help to improve school excellence, especially across the current era of globalization.},
