A mentor is defined as a veteran professional who either informally or formally guides a less experienced person in their academic or professional career \parencite{noauthor_what_2019}. Over the years, mentoring has become an important part of an individual's development and is valuable to any stage of their career.  \parencite{nottingham_effective_2017}. Using a mentor has proven to be a effective way of learning on the job. In a study conducted by \textcite{bjursell_mentorship_2018}, participants in a mentoring program were more effective in leadership roles when compared to participants in a traditional training program. The study determined success was because mentors have the ability to provide individual support to help their mentees understand their experiences. It also found that a mentor must know how to lead in a way that their mentee learns from their strengths and abilities.

Elijah and Elisha is a good example of a successful mentor-mentee relationship. The Lord used Elijah to train Elisha to become a prophet \parencite{Merida2015}. Elijah and Elisha developed such a strong bond that when Elisha was told to stay, he refused. "Then Elijah said to him, 'Stay here; the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.' And he replied, 'As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.' So the two of them walked on" \parencite[2 Kings 2:6]{bible}.

"An effective mentor needs to have both the professional management experience and the ability to transfer that knowledge to the mentee" \parencite[p. 39]{noauthor_what_2019}. A good mentor should also have more experience than their mentee as well as a track record of success \parencite{nottingham_effective_2017}. \textcite{nottingham_effective_2017} also states that a mentor should be honest, empathetic, and have similar values as their mentee.
